# DiscordBridge – Troubleshooting

← [Back to index](README.md)

---

## The bridge does not start / no messages are relayed

1. Check that `BotToken` and `ChannelId` are both set in the config file.
2. Confirm the bot is **in your Discord server** and has **Send Messages** and
   **Read Message History** permissions in the target channel.
3. Make sure all three **Privileged Gateway Intents** are enabled in the Discord
   Developer Portal (Presence, Server Members, Message Content).
4. Look in the server log (`FactoryGame.log`) for lines starting with `LogDiscordBridge`
   – they will contain details about any connection errors.

---

## Messages go one way only (game → Discord works, Discord → game doesn't)

- Verify **Message Content Intent** is enabled. Without it Discord does not send
  message content to bots, so the bridge cannot read Discord messages.

---

## The bot shows "offline" in Discord even while the server is running

- Discord caches presence state. Wait up to a minute or try restarting your Discord client.
- Make sure `bShowPlayerCountInPresence=True` and `PlayerCountPresenceFormat` is
  not empty.

---

## Messages from other bots are relayed into the game (echo loop)

- Set `bIgnoreBotMessages=True` (this is the default). This drops messages from
  any Discord account that has the `bot` flag set.

---

## The config gets reset after a mod update

- This is expected behaviour for the primary config. Your credentials are saved
  automatically to `<ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/DiscordBridge.ini` each
  session and will be restored automatically. If you want to be safe, keep a
  separate copy of your `BotToken` and `ChannelId` somewhere secure.

---

## Whitelist commands are not recognised / players are not being kicked

1. Make sure `WhitelistCommandPrefix` is set (default is `!whitelist`) and not empty.
2. Confirm the whitelist is **enabled** (`!whitelist status` in the Discord channel).
3. If using `WhitelistRoleId`, verify the bot has the **Manage Roles** permission on your Discord server.
4. Players are only kicked on **join** – the whitelist is checked when a player connects, not while they are already in the game.

---

## Ban commands are not recognised / banned players can still join

1. Make sure `BanCommandPrefix` is set (default is `!ban`) and not empty.
2. Run `!ban status` in the Discord channel to confirm the ban system is **enabled**. If it shows disabled, run `!ban on` or set `BanSystemEnabled=True` in `DefaultDiscordBridge.ini` and restart.
3. `BanSystemEnabled` in the config file is applied on **every** server restart — set it to `True` or `False` and restart to change the ban system state.
4. Players are only kicked on **join** — a ban takes effect the next time a banned player tries to connect, not while they are already in the game.

---

## In-game commands are not recognised

1. Make sure `InGameWhitelistCommandPrefix` and `InGameBanCommandPrefix` are set (both default to `!whitelist` and `!ban` respectively) and not empty in the config file.
2. In-game commands can only be typed in the **Satisfactory in-game chat** by players who are already connected to the server.
3. In-game whitelist commands do not include `!whitelist role add/remove` — that is Discord-only.
4. If the command appears to do nothing, check the server log (`FactoryGame.log`) for `LogDiscordBridge` or `LogWhitelistManager` / `LogBanManager` lines that may explain why it was rejected.

## Log verbosity

Add the following to your server's `DefaultEngine.ini` to increase log detail:

```ini
[Core.Log]
LogDiscordBridge=Verbose
```
