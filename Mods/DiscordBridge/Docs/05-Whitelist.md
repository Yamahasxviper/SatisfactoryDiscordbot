# DiscordBridge – Whitelist

← [Back to index](README.md)

The built-in whitelist lets you restrict which players can join the server and manage
the list directly from the bridged Discord channel.

> **The whitelist and the ban system are completely independent.**
> You can use either one, both, or neither — enabling or disabling one never affects the other.
>
> | Goal | Config |
> |------|--------|
> | Whitelist only | `WhitelistEnabled=True`, `BanSystemEnabled=False` |
> | Ban system only | `WhitelistEnabled=False`, `BanSystemEnabled=True` *(default)* |
> | Both | `WhitelistEnabled=True`, `BanSystemEnabled=True` |
> | Neither | `WhitelistEnabled=False`, `BanSystemEnabled=False` |

## Separate whitelist config file (optional)

All whitelist settings can be kept in their own dedicated file instead of (or in addition to)
`DefaultDiscordBridge.ini`:

```
<ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Mods/DiscordBridge/Config/DefaultDiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini
```

This file ships with the mod as an all-commented-out template. To use it:

1. Open `DefaultDiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini`.
2. Uncomment (remove the leading `;`) any setting you want to manage separately.
3. Set the value.
4. Restart the server.

Any setting defined in `DefaultDiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini` takes priority over the same
setting in `DefaultDiscordBridge.ini`. Settings left commented out in the separate file
continue to use whatever is in the primary config. This lets you, for example, keep your
bot token and chat settings in the main file while whitelist configuration lives in its own file.

## Settings

### `WhitelistEnabled`

Sets the initial whitelist state on the **first** server start (when
`ServerWhitelist.json` does not yet exist). After the first start the
enabled/disabled state is saved in `ServerWhitelist.json` and survives restarts
automatically — so `!whitelist on` / `!whitelist off` changes made from Discord
truly persist.

To force-reset back to this config value: delete `ServerWhitelist.json` and restart the server.

**Default:** `False` (all players can join)

---

### `WhitelistCommandRoleId`

The snowflake ID of the Discord role whose members are allowed to run `!whitelist` management commands.

**Default:** *(empty — !whitelist commands are disabled for all Discord users)*

When set, **only members who hold this role** can run `!whitelist` commands in the bridged Discord channel. When left empty, `!whitelist` commands are fully disabled (deny-by-default) — no one can run them until a role ID is provided.

> **IMPORTANT:** Holding this role does **not** grant access to the game server. These members are still subject to the normal whitelist and ban checks when they try to join.

**How to get the role ID:**
Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode), then right-click the role in Server Settings → Roles and choose **Copy Role ID**.

**Example:**
```ini
WhitelistCommandRoleId=123456789012345678
```

The whitelist admin role and the ban admin role are **completely independent** — you can assign different roles to each, or use the same role for both.

---

### `WhitelistCommandPrefix`

The prefix that triggers whitelist management commands when typed in the bridged Discord channel.
Set to an **empty string** to disable Discord-based whitelist management entirely.

**Default:** `!whitelist`

**Supported commands** (type these in the bridged Discord channel):

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `!whitelist on` | Enable the whitelist (only whitelisted players can join) |
| `!whitelist off` | Disable the whitelist (all players can join) |
| `!whitelist add <name>` | Add a player by in-game name |
| `!whitelist remove <name>` | Remove a player by in-game name |
| `!whitelist list` | List all whitelisted players |
| `!whitelist status` | Show the current enabled/disabled state of **both** the whitelist and the ban system |
| `!whitelist role add <discord_id>` | Grant the `WhitelistRoleId` Discord role to a user |
| `!whitelist role remove <discord_id>` | Revoke the `WhitelistRoleId` Discord role from a user |

---

### `WhitelistRoleId`

The snowflake ID of the Discord role used to identify whitelisted members.
Leave **empty** to disable Discord role integration.

**Default:** *(empty)*

When set:
- Discord messages sent to `WhitelistChannelId` are relayed to the game **only when the sender holds this role**.
- The `!whitelist role add/remove <discord_id>` commands assign or revoke this role via the Discord REST API (the bot must have the **Manage Roles** permission on your server).
- **Players whose in-game name matches a Discord display name (server nickname, global name, or username) of a member who holds this role are automatically allowed through the whitelist, even if they are not listed in `ServerWhitelist.json`.** The bot fetches and caches the role-member list when it connects, and keeps it up to date as members gain or lose the role.

> **Tip:** For reliable matching, set each player's Discord server nickname to their exact in-game (Steam/Epic) name before granting them the whitelist role.

**How to get the role ID:**
Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode), then right-click the role in Server Settings → Roles and choose **Copy Role ID**.

---

### `WhitelistChannelId`

The snowflake ID of a dedicated Discord channel for whitelisted members.
Leave **empty** to disable the whitelist-only channel.

**Default:** *(empty)*

When set:
- In-game messages from players on the server whitelist are **also** posted to this channel (in addition to the main `ChannelId`).
- Discord messages sent to this channel are relayed to the game **only when the sender holds `WhitelistRoleId`** (if `WhitelistRoleId` is configured).

Get the channel ID the same way as `ChannelId` (right-click the channel in Discord with Developer Mode enabled → **Copy Channel ID**).

---

### `WhitelistKickDiscordMessage`

The message posted to the **main** Discord channel whenever a non-whitelisted player attempts to join and is kicked.
Leave **empty** to disable this notification.

**Default:** `:boot: **%PlayerName%** tried to join but is not on the whitelist and was kicked.`

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|-------------|---------------|
| `%PlayerName%` | The in-game name of the player who was kicked |

**Example:**

```ini
WhitelistKickDiscordMessage=:no_entry: **%PlayerName%** is not whitelisted and was removed from the server.
```

---

### `WhitelistKickReason`

The reason shown **in-game** to the player when they are kicked for not being on the whitelist.
This is the text the player sees in the disconnected / kicked screen.

**Default:** `You are not on this server's whitelist. Contact the server admin to be added.`

**Example:**

```ini
WhitelistKickReason=You are not whitelisted. DM an admin on Discord to request access.
```

---

### `InGameWhitelistCommandPrefix`

The prefix that triggers whitelist management commands when typed in the **Satisfactory in-game chat**.
This lets server admins manage the whitelist directly from inside the game without needing Discord.
Set to an **empty string** to disable in-game whitelist commands.

**Default:** `!whitelist`

**Supported commands** (type these in the Satisfactory in-game chat):

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `!whitelist on` | Enable the whitelist |
| `!whitelist off` | Disable the whitelist (all players can join) |
| `!whitelist add <name>` | Add a player by in-game name |
| `!whitelist remove <name>` | Remove a player by in-game name |
| `!whitelist list` | List all whitelisted players |
| `!whitelist status` | Show the current enabled/disabled state of **both** the whitelist and the ban system |

> **Note:** In-game whitelist commands support the same operations as the Discord commands,
> except for role management (`!whitelist role add/remove`) which is Discord-only.
