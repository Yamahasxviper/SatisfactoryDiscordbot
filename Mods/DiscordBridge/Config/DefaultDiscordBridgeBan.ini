; DiscordBridge - Ban System Configuration (Optional Override File)
; =================================================================
; This file is OPTIONAL. Any settings you uncomment and fill in here
; take priority over built-in defaults.
; Settings that are left commented out use their built-in defaults.
;
; USAGE:
;   1. Uncomment (remove the leading ';') the settings you want to configure.
;   2. Set their values.
;   3. Restart the server.
;
; All other settings (connection, chat, whitelist, etc.) are unaffected by
; this file and must still be configured in DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.
;
; NOTE: This file ships with the mod and may be reset by mod updates. The mod
; automatically backs it up to:
;   <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/DiscordBridgeBan.ini
; and restores your settings from that backup if this file is ever reset.
