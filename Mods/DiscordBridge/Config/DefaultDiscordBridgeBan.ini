[DiscordBridge]
Note=Uncomment settings below and restart the server. All settings are optional.
; DiscordBridge - Ban System Configuration (Optional Override File)
; =================================================================
; 1. Remove the leading ';' from each setting you want to enable below.
; 2. Fill in the value after the '='.
; 3. Restart the server. Settings here take priority over built-in defaults.
; Backup: <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/DiscordBridgeBan.ini (auto-saved)
;   The mod writes a backup of your ban settings here automatically so they
;   survive mod updates that reset this file. The backup is only written when at
;   least one setting below is uncommented (active).
; All other settings (connection, chat, whitelist, etc.) are in DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.

; -- BAN SYSTEM ---------------------------------------------------------------
; Controls the built-in player ban system, manageable via Discord commands.
; Bans are stored in <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/ServerBanlist.json and
; persist across server restarts automatically.
; Ban system and whitelist are INDEPENDENT (see DefaultDiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini).
; You can use either, both, or neither:
;   Ban only:  BanSystemEnabled=True,  WhitelistEnabled=False  (default)
;   Both:      BanSystemEnabled=True,  WhitelistEnabled=True
;   Neither:   BanSystemEnabled=False, WhitelistEnabled=False

; Controls whether the ban system is active when the server starts.
; When True, players listed in ServerBanlist.json are kicked on join.
; When False, banned players can join freely (bans are not enforced).
; This value is applied on EVERY server restart – it is the authoritative
; toggle. Note: !ban on / !ban off Discord commands update the in-memory state
; for the current session only and do not override this config value.
; Default: True (ban list is enforced on every server start)
;BanSystemEnabled=True

; Snowflake ID of the Discord role whose members are allowed to run !ban commands.
; When set, ONLY members who hold this role can issue !ban commands in the bridged
; Discord channel. When left empty, !ban commands are disabled for all Discord
; users (deny-by-default) until a role ID is provided.
; This role is also granted or revoked by the !ban role add/remove <discord_id>
; commands, letting ban admins promote or demote other Discord members without
; needing Discord server management access (bot must have Manage Roles permission).
; IMPORTANT: holding this role does NOT bypass the ban check on join – role holders
; are still kicked if their in-game name is on the ban list.
; How to get the role ID: Discord Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode, then
; right-click the role in Server Settings -> Roles -> Copy Role ID.
; Example: BanCommandRoleId=987654321098765432
;BanCommandRoleId=

; Prefix that triggers ban management commands when typed in the bridged Discord
; channel. Set to an empty string to disable Discord-based ban management.
; Supported commands (type in the bridged Discord channel):
;   !ban add <name>               – ban a player by in-game name
;   !ban remove <name>            – unban a player by in-game name
;   !ban list                     – list all banned players
;   !ban status                   – show current ban system and whitelist state
;   !ban on                       – enable the ban system for this session
;   !ban off                      – disable the ban system for this session
;   !ban role add <discord_id>    – grant the BanCommandRoleId role to a Discord user
;   !ban role remove <discord_id> – revoke the BanCommandRoleId role from a Discord user
; Default: !ban
;BanCommandPrefix=!ban

; Snowflake ID of a dedicated Discord channel for ban management.
; Leave empty to disable the ban-only channel.
; When set:
;   - !ban commands issued from this channel are accepted (sender must still
;     hold BanCommandRoleId). Responses are sent back to this channel.
;   - Ban-kick notifications are ALSO posted here in addition to the main
;     ChannelId, giving admins a focused audit log of all ban events.
;   - Non-ban-command messages in this channel are silently ignored.
; Tip: combine this with BanCommandRoleId and a private admin channel for a
; fully locked-down ban management workflow.
; How to get the channel ID: right-click the channel in Discord with Developer
; Mode enabled -> Copy Channel ID.
; Example: BanChannelId=567890123456789012
;BanChannelId=

; Master on/off switch for the ban command interface.
; When True (default), !ban Discord and in-game commands are accepted (still
; gated by BanCommandRoleId). When False, all !ban commands are silently
; ignored while existing bans are STILL enforced on join (BanSystemEnabled is
; unaffected). Use this to lock down the command interface without disabling
; ban enforcement.
; Default: True
;BanCommandsEnabled=True

; Message posted to the main Discord channel whenever a banned player tries to
; join and is kicked. Leave empty (delete the text after the =) to disable
; this notification.
; Available placeholder:
;   %PlayerName%  – the in-game name of the banned player who was kicked
; Example: BanKickDiscordMessage=:no_entry: **%PlayerName%** is banned and was removed.
;BanKickDiscordMessage=:hammer: **%PlayerName%** is banned from this server and was kicked.

; Text shown in-game to the player in the disconnected / kicked screen when
; they are kicked because they are on the ban list.
; Default: You are banned from this server.
; Example: BanKickReason=You have been banned. Contact the server admin to appeal.
;BanKickReason=

; Prefix that triggers ban management commands when typed in the Satisfactory
; in-game chat. Lets server admins manage bans from inside the game without
; needing Discord. Set to an empty string to disable in-game ban commands.
; Supported commands (type in the Satisfactory in-game chat):
;   !ban add <name>    – ban a player by in-game name
;   !ban remove <name> – unban a player by in-game name
;   !ban list          – list all banned players
;   !ban status        – show current ban system and whitelist state
;   !ban on            – enable the ban system for this session
;   !ban off           – disable the ban system for this session
; Note: in-game ban commands do not support role management (!ban role add/remove),
; which is available from Discord only.
; Default: !ban
;InGameBanCommandPrefix=!ban
