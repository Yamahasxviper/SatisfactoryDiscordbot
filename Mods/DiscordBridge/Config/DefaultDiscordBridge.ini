[DiscordBridge]
; DiscordBridge - Primary Configuration File
; ===========================================
; 1. Set BotToken and ChannelId below.
; 2. Restart the server. The bridge starts automatically.
; Backup: <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/DiscordBridge.ini (auto-saved)
;   The mod writes a backup of your credentials here automatically. If a mod
;   update resets this file, the mod falls back to the backup so the bridge
;   keeps working until you copy your credentials back.
; Optional separate files (settings there take priority over what is set below):
;   DefaultDiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini  – whitelist settings only
;   DefaultDiscordBridgeBan.ini         – ban system settings only
; Bot setup: Discord Developer Portal -> your app -> Bot
;   - Enable Presence, Server Members and Message Content intents.
;   - Invite the bot with Send Messages + Read Message History permissions.
;   - Enable Developer Mode in Discord, right-click the channel, Copy Channel ID.

; -- CONNECTION ---------------------------------------------------------------

; Discord bot token (Bot -> Token in Developer Portal). Treat this like a
; password – never share it or commit it to source control. The bridge will
; not start if this is empty.
; How to get it: Discord Developer Portal -> your app -> Bot -> Reset Token.
BotToken=

; Snowflake ID of the Discord text channel to bridge with in-game chat.
; Must be a numeric ID, e.g. 123456789012345678.
; How to get it: enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings -> Advanced ->
; Developer Mode), then right-click the target channel and choose Copy Channel ID.
ChannelId=

; Display name for this server. Used as the %ServerName% placeholder in message
; format strings and the player-count presence text. Leave empty to omit the
; server label from those strings.
; Example: ServerName=My Satisfactory Server
ServerName=

; -- CHAT CUSTOMISATION -------------------------------------------------------

; Format string applied when an in-game player message is forwarded to Discord.
; Available placeholders:
;   %ServerName%  – value of the ServerName setting above
;   %PlayerName%  – the in-game name of the player who sent the message
;   %Message%     – the raw chat message text
; Discord markdown (bold, italics, code blocks, etc.) is supported.
; Default: **%PlayerName%**: %Message%
; Example (include server label): **[%ServerName%] %PlayerName%**: %Message%
GameToDiscordFormat=

; Format string used as the message body shown in the Satisfactory in-game chat
; when a Discord message is relayed into the game.
; Available placeholders:
;   %Username%    – the Discord display name of the sender
;   %PlayerName%  – alias for %Username%
;   %Message%     – the Discord message text
; Default: %Message%  (just the raw Discord message)
; Example (prepend sender): %Username%: %Message%
DiscordToGameFormat=

; Format string used for the sender name column in the Satisfactory in-game chat
; UI when a Discord message arrives. This is the name shown to the left of the
; message, not the message body itself.
; Available placeholders:
;   %Username%    – the Discord display name of the sender
;   %PlayerName%  – alias for %Username%
; Default: [Discord] %Username%
; Example (no prefix): %Username%
DiscordSenderFormat=

; -- BEHAVIOUR ----------------------------------------------------------------

; When True, messages posted by other bots are ignored and not relayed to the
; game. This prevents echo loops when multiple bots share the same channel.
; Set to False only if you intentionally want bot messages forwarded in-game.
; Default: True
IgnoreBotMessages=

; -- SERVER STATUS MESSAGES ---------------------------------------------------

; Message posted to the bridged Discord channel when the server finishes starting
; up. Leave empty (delete the text after the =) to disable this notification.
; Discord emoji shortcodes such as :green_circle: are supported.
ServerOnlineMessage=:green_circle: Server is now **online**!

; Message posted to the bridged Discord channel when the server shuts down.
; Leave empty to disable this notification.
ServerOfflineMessage=:red_circle: Server is now **offline**.

; -- PLAYER COUNT PRESENCE ----------------------------------------------------

; When True, the bot's Discord status (the "Now Playing" activity line visible
; on the bot's profile) is updated periodically to show the live player count.
; Set to False to leave the bot status blank.
; Default: True
ShowPlayerCountInPresence=

; Text shown in the bot's Discord presence activity line.
; Available placeholders:
;   %PlayerCount%  – the current number of players on the server
;   %ServerName%   – value of the ServerName setting above
; Default: Satisfactory with %PlayerCount% players
; Example (show server name): %ServerName% – %PlayerCount% online
PlayerCountPresenceFormat=

; How often (in seconds) to refresh the player count shown in the bot's presence.
; Must be at least 15 seconds (values below 15 are clamped to 15 to respect
; Discord's rate limits). Increase this if you want less frequent updates.
; Default: 60
PlayerCountUpdateIntervalSeconds=

; Controls the activity verb shown before the presence text in Discord.
; This is the word that appears in front of your PlayerCountPresenceFormat text
; on the bot's profile card.
;   0 = Playing        -> "Playing Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   2 = Listening to   -> "Listening to Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   3 = Watching       -> "Watching Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   5 = Competing in   -> "Competing in Satisfactory with 4 players"
; Default: 0 (Playing)
PlayerCountActivityType=

; -- WHITELIST / BAN SYSTEM ---------------------------------------------------
; Whitelist and ban system settings are configured in their own dedicated files:
;   DefaultDiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini  – all whitelist settings
;   DefaultDiscordBridgeBan.ini         – all ban system settings
; Those files ship with the mod. Uncomment and fill in the settings you need
; there, then restart the server. No whitelist or ban settings are required here.
