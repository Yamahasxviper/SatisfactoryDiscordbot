; NOTE: This file is no longer used by the DiscordBridge mod.
;
; The mod now stores its configuration as a JSON file at:
;   FactoryGame/Configs/DiscordBridge.cfg
;
; That file is created automatically with sensible defaults the first time the
; server starts with DiscordBridge installed.  Edit it to set BotToken and
; ChannelId, then restart the server.
