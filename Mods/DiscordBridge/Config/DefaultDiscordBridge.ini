; NOTE: This file is not the live configuration for the DiscordBridge mod.
;
; The mod stores its configuration as a JSON file inside its own folder at:
;   <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Mods/DiscordBridge/Config/DiscordBridge.cfg
;
; That file is created automatically with sensible defaults the first time the
; server starts with DiscordBridge installed.  Edit it to set BotToken and
; ChannelId, then restart the server.
;
; Because DiscordBridge.cfg is generated at runtime (not shipped with the mod),
; Alpakit mod updates will never overwrite it.
