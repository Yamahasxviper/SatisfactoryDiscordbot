; ── WHITELIST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; Controls the built-in server whitelist, manageable via Discord commands.
;
; The whitelist and the ban system are COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT of each other.
; You can use either one, both, or neither:
;   Whitelist only:   WhitelistEnabled=True,  BanSystemEnabled=False
;   Ban system only:  WhitelistEnabled=False, BanSystemEnabled=True  (default)
;   Both:             WhitelistEnabled=True,  BanSystemEnabled=True
;   Neither:          WhitelistEnabled=False, BanSystemEnabled=False
; Enabling or disabling one system never affects the other.

; Sets the initial whitelist state on the FIRST server start (when
; ServerWhitelist.json does not yet exist).  After the first start, the
; enabled/disabled state is saved in ServerWhitelist.json and survives restarts,
; so runtime !whitelist on / !whitelist off changes truly persist.
; To force-reset to this config value: delete ServerWhitelist.json and restart.
; Default: False (all players can join).
WhitelistEnabled=False

; Snowflake ID of the Discord role whose members may run !whitelist commands.
; Leave empty (default) to disable !whitelist commands for all Discord users —
; only members who hold this role can run them.
;
; How to get the role ID:
;   Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode (enable it), then right-click
;   the role in Server Settings → Roles and choose "Copy Role ID".
;
; IMPORTANT: holding this role does NOT grant access to the game server.
; These members are still subject to whitelist/ban checks when they join.
;
; Example: WhitelistCommandRoleId=123456789012345678
WhitelistCommandRoleId=

; Prefix that triggers whitelist management commands when typed in the bridged
; Discord channel.  Set to an empty string to disable Discord-based management.
;
; Supported commands:
;   !whitelist on                       – enable the whitelist
;   !whitelist off                      – disable the whitelist (all players can join)
;   !whitelist add <name>               – add a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist remove <name>            – remove a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist list                     – list all whitelisted players
;   !whitelist status                   – show current state of both systems
;   !whitelist role add <discord_id>    – grant WhitelistRoleId to a Discord user
;   !whitelist role remove <discord_id> – revoke WhitelistRoleId from a Discord user
WhitelistCommandPrefix=!whitelist

; Snowflake ID of the Discord role assigned to whitelisted members.
; Leave empty to disable Discord role integration.
;
; When set:
;   • Messages in WhitelistChannelId are relayed to game only when the sender
;     holds this role.
;   • !whitelist role add/remove commands assign or revoke this role via the
;     Discord REST API (bot must have Manage Roles permission on your server).
;
; How to get the role ID:
;   Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode (enable it), then right-click
;   the role in Server Settings → Roles and choose "Copy Role ID".
;
; Example: WhitelistRoleId=234567890123456789
WhitelistRoleId=

; Snowflake ID of a dedicated Discord channel for whitelisted members.
; Leave empty to disable the whitelist-only channel.
;
; When set:
;   • In-game messages from players who are on the server whitelist are ALSO
;     posted to this channel (in addition to the main ChannelId above).
;   • Discord messages sent to this channel are relayed to the game only when
;     the sender holds WhitelistRoleId (if WhitelistRoleId is configured).
;
; Get the channel ID the same way as ChannelId above (right-click the channel
; in Discord with Developer Mode enabled → Copy Channel ID).
;
; Example: WhitelistChannelId=345678901234567890
WhitelistChannelId=

; Message posted to the main Discord channel when a non-whitelisted player is
; kicked.  Leave empty to disable this notification.
;
; Placeholder:
;   %PlayerName%  – in-game name of the player who was kicked.
;
; Examples:
;   WhitelistKickDiscordMessage=:boot: **%PlayerName%** tried to join but is not on the whitelist and was kicked.
;   WhitelistKickDiscordMessage=:no_entry: **%PlayerName%** is not whitelisted and was removed from the server.
WhitelistKickDiscordMessage=:boot: **%PlayerName%** tried to join but is not on the whitelist and was kicked.

; Reason shown in-game to the player when they are kicked for not being whitelisted.
; This is the text the player sees in the Disconnected / kicked screen.
;
; Examples:
;   WhitelistKickReason=You are not on this server's whitelist. Contact the server admin to be added.
;   WhitelistKickReason=You are not whitelisted. DM an admin on Discord to request access.
WhitelistKickReason=You are not on this server's whitelist. Contact the server admin to be added.

; ── BAN SYSTEM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; Controls the built-in player ban system, manageable via Discord commands.
; Bans are stored in <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/ServerBanlist.json and
; persist across server restarts automatically.
;
; The ban system and the whitelist are COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT of each other.
; You can use either one, both, or neither — see the WHITELIST section above.
; Enabling or disabling one system never affects the other.

; Sets the initial ban-system state on the FIRST server start (when
; ServerBanlist.json does not yet exist).  After the first start, the
; enabled/disabled state is saved in ServerBanlist.json and survives restarts,
; so runtime !ban on / !ban off changes truly persist.
; To force-reset to this config value: delete ServerBanlist.json and restart.
; Default: True (banned players are kicked on join).
BanSystemEnabled=True

; Snowflake ID of the Discord role whose members may run !ban commands.
; Leave empty (default) to disable !ban commands for all Discord users —
; only members who hold this role can run them.
; Get the role ID the same way as WhitelistCommandRoleId above.
;
; IMPORTANT: holding this role does NOT bypass the ban check when joining.
; These members are still banned if their name appears on the ban list.
;
; Example: BanCommandRoleId=987654321098765432
BanCommandRoleId=

; Prefix that triggers ban management commands when typed in the bridged
; Discord channel.  Set to an empty string to disable Discord-based ban management.
;
; Supported commands:
;   !ban add <name>    – ban a player by in-game name
;   !ban remove <name> – unban a player by in-game name
;   !ban list          – list all banned players
;   !ban status        – show current state of both systems
;   !ban on            – enable the ban system (persists across restarts)
;   !ban off           – disable the ban system (persists across restarts)
BanCommandPrefix=!ban

; Message posted to the main Discord channel when a banned player tries to join.
; Leave empty to disable this notification.
;
; Placeholder:
;   %PlayerName%  – in-game name of the player who was kicked.
;
; Examples:
;   BanKickDiscordMessage=:hammer: **%PlayerName%** is banned from this server and was kicked.
;   BanKickDiscordMessage=:no_entry: **%PlayerName%** is banned and was removed.
BanKickDiscordMessage=:hammer: **%PlayerName%** is banned from this server and was kicked.

; Reason shown in-game to the player when they are kicked for being banned.
; This is the text the player sees in the Disconnected / kicked screen.
;
; Examples:
;   BanKickReason=You are banned from this server.
;   BanKickReason=You have been banned. Contact the server admin to appeal.
BanKickReason=You are banned from this server.

; ── IN-GAME COMMANDS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; These settings control commands that server admins can type in the Satisfactory
; in-game chat to manage the whitelist and ban list without using Discord.
; In-game commands support the same operations as Discord commands, except for
; role management (e.g. !whitelist role add/remove) which is Discord-only.

; Prefix that triggers whitelist commands when typed in the in-game chat.
; Set to an empty string to disable in-game whitelist commands.
;
; Supported commands (type in Satisfactory chat):
;   !whitelist on            – enable the whitelist
;   !whitelist off           – disable the whitelist (all players can join)
;   !whitelist add <name>    – add a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist remove <name> – remove a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist list          – list all whitelisted players
;   !whitelist status        – show current state of both systems
InGameWhitelistCommandPrefix=!whitelist

; Prefix that triggers ban commands when typed in the in-game chat.
; Set to an empty string to disable in-game ban commands.
;
; Supported commands (type in Satisfactory chat):
;   !ban on            – enable the ban system
;   !ban off           – disable the ban system
;   !ban add <name>    – ban a player by in-game name
;   !ban remove <name> – unban a player by in-game name
;   !ban list          – list all banned players
;   !ban status        – show current state of both systems
InGameBanCommandPrefix=!ban

; ── BEHAVIOUR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; When True, messages from bot accounts are ignored (prevents echo loops where
; the bot reads its own messages and re-posts them back to the game).
; Default: True.  Only set to False if you intentionally want bot messages relayed.
bIgnoreBotMessages=True

; ── SERVER STATUS MESSAGES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; These messages are posted to Discord when the server starts or stops.
; Leave a value empty to disable that notification.
; Discord emoji codes (e.g. :green_circle:) are supported.

; Message posted to Discord when the server comes online.
; Example: ServerOnlineMessage=:green_circle: **%ServerName%** is now **online**!
ServerOnlineMessage=:green_circle: Server is now **online**!

; Message posted to Discord when the server shuts down.
; Example: ServerOfflineMessage=:red_circle: **%ServerName%** is now **offline**.
ServerOfflineMessage=:red_circle: Server is now **offline**.

; ── PLAYER COUNT PRESENCE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
; Controls the bot's Discord status (the "Now Playing" activity).

; When True, the bot's Discord presence is updated periodically to show the
; current number of connected players.  Set to False to leave the bot status blank.
; Default: True.
bShowPlayerCountInPresence=True

; The text shown in the bot's Discord presence.
; Write anything you like, or use the placeholders below.
;   %PlayerCount%  – current number of connected players
;   %ServerName%   – value of ServerName above
;
; When left empty the presence falls back to displaying just the raw player count.
;
; Examples:
;   PlayerCountPresenceFormat=Satisfactory with %PlayerCount% players
;     → Discord shows:  "Playing Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   PlayerCountPresenceFormat=%ServerName% – %PlayerCount% online
;     → Discord shows:  "Playing My Server – 4 online"
;   PlayerCountPresenceFormat=%PlayerCount% players online
;     → Discord shows:  "Playing 4 players online"
PlayerCountPresenceFormat=Satisfactory with %PlayerCount% players

; How often (in seconds) to refresh the player count in the bot's presence.
; Minimum value is 15 seconds (values below 15 are clamped to 15 to respect
; Discord's rate limits).  Default is 60 seconds.
PlayerCountUpdateIntervalSeconds=60.0

; Discord activity type – controls the verb Discord shows before the text.
;   0 = Playing         →  "Playing Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   2 = Listening to    →  "Listening to Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   3 = Watching        →  "Watching Satisfactory with 4 players"
;   5 = Competing in    →  "Competing in Satisfactory with 4 players"
; Default: 0 (Playing).
PlayerCountActivityType=0
