; DiscordBridge - Whitelist Configuration (Optional Override File)
; ================================================================
; This file is OPTIONAL. Any settings you uncomment and fill in here take
; priority over the same settings in DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.
; Settings that are left commented out fall back to DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.
;
; USAGE:
;   1. Uncomment (remove the leading ';') the settings you want to manage here.
;   2. Set their values.
;   3. Restart the server. These values override DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.
;
; All other settings (connection, chat, ban system, etc.) are unaffected by
; this file and must still be configured in DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.
;
; NOTE: This file ships with the mod and may be reset by mod updates. Your
; settings in DefaultDiscordBridge.ini are backed up automatically to
; <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/DiscordBridge.ini and survive updates.

; -- WHITELIST ----------------------------------------------------------------
; Controls the built-in server whitelist, manageable via Discord commands.
; Whitelist and ban system are INDEPENDENT - use either, both, or neither:
;   Whitelist only:  WhitelistEnabled=True,  BanSystemEnabled=False
;   Ban only:        WhitelistEnabled=False, BanSystemEnabled=True  (default)
;   Both:            WhitelistEnabled=True,  BanSystemEnabled=True
;   Neither:         WhitelistEnabled=False, BanSystemEnabled=False
