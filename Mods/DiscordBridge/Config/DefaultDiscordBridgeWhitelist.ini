; DiscordBridge - Whitelist Configuration (Optional Override File)
; ================================================================
; 1. Fill in the values you want to set below.
; 2. Restart the server. Settings here take priority over built-in defaults.
; Backup: <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/DiscordBridgeWhitelist.ini (auto-saved)
;   The mod writes a backup of your whitelist settings here automatically so they
;   survive mod updates that reset this file.
; All other settings (connection, chat, ban system, etc.) are in DefaultDiscordBridge.ini.

; -- WHITELIST ----------------------------------------------------------------
; Controls the built-in server whitelist, manageable via Discord commands.
; Whitelist entries are stored in <ServerRoot>/FactoryGame/Saved/ServerWhitelist.json
; and persist across server restarts automatically.
; Whitelist and ban system are INDEPENDENT - use either, both, or neither:
;   Whitelist only:  WhitelistEnabled=True,  BanSystemEnabled=False
;   Ban only:        WhitelistEnabled=False, BanSystemEnabled=True  (default)
;   Both:            WhitelistEnabled=True,  BanSystemEnabled=True
;   Neither:         WhitelistEnabled=False, BanSystemEnabled=False

; Controls whether the whitelist is active when the server starts.
; When True, only players listed in ServerWhitelist.json (or who hold the
; WhitelistRoleId Discord role, if configured) are allowed to join.
; When False, all players can join regardless of the whitelist.
; This value is applied on EVERY server restart – it is the authoritative
; toggle. Note: !whitelist on / !whitelist off Discord commands update the
; in-memory state for the current session only and do not override this value.
; Default: False
WhitelistEnabled=False

; Snowflake ID of the Discord role whose members are allowed to run !whitelist
; commands. When set, ONLY members who hold this role can issue !whitelist
; commands in the bridged Discord channel. When left empty, !whitelist commands
; are disabled for all Discord users (deny-by-default) until a role ID is provided.
; IMPORTANT: holding this role does NOT grant access to the game server. Role
; holders are still subject to the normal whitelist and ban checks when joining.
; How to get the role ID: Discord Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode, then
; right-click the role in Server Settings -> Roles -> Copy Role ID.
; Example: WhitelistCommandRoleId=123456789012345678
WhitelistCommandRoleId=

; Prefix that triggers whitelist management commands when typed in the bridged
; Discord channel. Set to an empty string to disable Discord-based whitelist
; management entirely.
; Supported commands (type in the bridged Discord channel):
;   !whitelist on                       – enable the whitelist
;   !whitelist off                      – disable the whitelist (all players can join)
;   !whitelist add <name>               – add a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist remove <name>            – remove a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist list                     – list all whitelisted players
;   !whitelist status                   – show current whitelist and ban system state
;   !whitelist role add <discord_id>    – grant the WhitelistRoleId role to a Discord user
;   !whitelist role remove <discord_id> – revoke the WhitelistRoleId role from a Discord user
; Default: !whitelist
WhitelistCommandPrefix=!whitelist

; Snowflake ID of the Discord role used to identify whitelisted members.
; Leave empty to disable Discord role integration.
; When set:
;   - Players whose in-game name matches a Discord display name (server nickname,
;     global name, or username) of a member who holds this role are automatically
;     allowed through the whitelist without needing an explicit entry in
;     ServerWhitelist.json. The bot caches the role-member list on startup and
;     keeps it up to date via Discord member events.
;   - Discord messages sent to WhitelistChannelId are relayed to the game ONLY
;     when the sender holds this role.
;   - The !whitelist role add/remove <discord_id> commands assign or revoke this
;     role via the Discord REST API (bot must have Manage Roles permission).
; Tip: for reliable matching, set each player's Discord server nickname to their
; exact in-game (Steam/Epic) name before granting them the whitelist role.
; How to get the role ID: Discord Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode, then
; right-click the role in Server Settings -> Roles -> Copy Role ID.
; Example: WhitelistRoleId=111222333444555666
WhitelistRoleId=

; Snowflake ID of a dedicated Discord channel for whitelisted members.
; Leave empty to disable the whitelist-only channel.
; When set:
;   - In-game messages from players on the server whitelist are ALSO posted to
;     this channel (in addition to the main ChannelId).
;   - Discord messages sent to this channel are relayed to the game ONLY when
;     the sender holds WhitelistRoleId (if that field is non-empty).
; How to get the channel ID: right-click the channel in Discord with Developer
; Mode enabled -> Copy Channel ID.
; Example: WhitelistChannelId=222333444555666777
WhitelistChannelId=

; Message posted to the main Discord channel whenever a non-whitelisted player
; tries to join and is kicked. Leave empty (delete the text after the =) to
; disable this notification.
; Available placeholder:
;   %PlayerName%  – the in-game name of the player who was kicked
; Example: WhitelistKickDiscordMessage=:no_entry: **%PlayerName%** is not whitelisted and was removed.
WhitelistKickDiscordMessage=:boot: **%PlayerName%** tried to join but is not on the whitelist and was kicked.

; Text shown in-game to the player in the disconnected / kicked screen when
; they are kicked because they are not on the whitelist.
; Default: You are not on this server's whitelist. Contact the server admin to be added.
; Example: WhitelistKickReason=You are not whitelisted. DM an admin on Discord to request access.
WhitelistKickReason=

; Prefix that triggers whitelist management commands when typed in the
; Satisfactory in-game chat. Lets server admins manage the whitelist from
; inside the game without needing Discord. Set to an empty string to disable
; in-game whitelist commands.
; Supported commands (type in the Satisfactory in-game chat):
;   !whitelist on            – enable the whitelist
;   !whitelist off           – disable the whitelist (all players can join)
;   !whitelist add <name>    – add a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist remove <name> – remove a player by in-game name
;   !whitelist list          – list all whitelisted players
;   !whitelist status        – show current whitelist and ban system state
; Note: in-game whitelist commands do not support role management
; (!whitelist role add/remove), which is available from Discord only.
; Default: !whitelist
InGameWhitelistCommandPrefix=!whitelist
