WebSockets work perfectly on Windows dedicated servers! See [WEBSOCKET_WINDOWS_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY.md](WEBSOCKET_WINDOWS_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY.md) for comprehensive Windows server documentation.

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPATIBLE** with Windows servers (Win64, requires Windows 8.1+/Server 2012 R2+)

#### Linux Servers
Testing WebSocket functionality for Linux servers? See [WEBSOCKET_LINUX_TESTING.md](WEBSOCKET_LINUX_TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing instructions.

**Quick test:**
```bash
./scripts/test_websocket_linux_compatibility.sh
```

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY COMPATIBLE** with Linux servers (x86_64, ARM64)

### Proxy Support

## Discord Chat Bridge Mod

This repository includes the **Discord Chat Bridge** mod, which provides two-way chat integration between Satisfactory in-game chat and Discord.

> **⚠️ CONFIGURATION REQUIRED**  
> After installation, you **must configure the mod** with your Discord bot token and channel ID. The server will start normally without configuration, but Discord integration will be **inactive** until configured. See the [Quick Start Guide](Mods/DiscordChatBridge/help/QUICKSTART.md) for setup instructions.

> **✅ NO CLIENT INSTALLATION REQUIRED**  
> Players connecting to your server **do not need to install anything**. This mod runs entirely on the server side. Only the server administrator needs to install and configure the mod.
> 
> **Technical Implementation:** The mod uses `"RequiredOnRemote": false` in its plugin descriptor and `SpawnOnServer` replication policy to ensure it runs only on the server and allows vanilla clients to connect.

### Features
- Two-way chat synchronization between Satisfactory and Discord
- Uses Discord Bot Token (no webhooks required)
- Configurable through INI or TXT file formats
- **Server-side only** - Players join and chat normally, no mod installation needed
